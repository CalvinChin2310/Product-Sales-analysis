# Product Sales Analysis
This repository contains a Python project for analyzing product sales data. It includes scripts for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of sales trends.

# Overview
The project aims to provide insights into product sales performance, identify key trends, and answer important business questions related to sales data. It covers various aspects of data analysis, including:

- Data cleaning: Removing missing values, standardizing date formats, and ensuring data integrity.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Investigating sales patterns, identifying top-selling products, analyzing sales by month and city, and determining optimal advertisement timings.
- Visualization: Visualizing sales data using bar plots, line plots, and other graphical representations.

# Features
- Data Importing: Importing sales data from multiple CSV files and merging them into a single DataFrame.
- Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, standardizing date formats, and ensuring data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing sales trends by month, city, and product category.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to present sales data effectively.
- Key Insights: Extracting actionable insights from the sales data to inform business decisions.
